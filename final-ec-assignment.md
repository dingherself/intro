---

*Due*: Monday, December 8, in hard copy, at the beginning of class<br />*Format*: 2–3 pages

If you decide to go to (or watch) one of the lectures/events posted, you can earn up to 3 extra credit points on your final exam by writing a response paper. Please use half of the space to summarize the lecture/event and the other half to critically engage with it (raise a question or worry, connect it to something we discussed in class, apply it to our current context, etc.). You may receive the extra credit for only one such event.
