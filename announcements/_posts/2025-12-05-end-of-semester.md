title: "Course Evaluations & My Office Hours Next Week"
---

Dear class,

I want to encourage you again to complete course evaluations, which will close by midnight on Thursday, December 11. I want to hear your feedback! If you have enjoyed the class, tell me about it and use this as an opportunity to reflect on your experience; if you have suggestions about which aspects of the course are and are not working, they will inform and shape the way I teach in the future. The results are fully anonymous and won’t be released until after your final course grades are posted.

Also, the finals are scrambling my schedule:

- I’ll still have my regular office hours this upcoming Monday, December 8.
- On Wednesday the 10th, I have a conflict but can meet by appointment after 1:45-ish.
- I may have time to meet on Thursday the 11th, though I’m not sure yet—just email me!
- On Monday, December 15, we could potentially meet in my office while my students in Phil 3701 take their final exam (1:10–3:10pm). Again email me ahead of time.

I hope the end of the semester is being kind to all of you! Best of luck with your finals, and please don’t forget to find some time to recharge and take care of yourself.

All my best,\
Ding
