title: "TA Office Hours This Semester"
---

Hello all,

I hope the beginning of your semester has been well. My office hours this semester will be Tuesday 2-3 and Wednesday 3-4 in Philosophy Hall 722. Please come if you have any questions about the course or about the material, or if you would like to chat about anything philosophical. Philosophy is a fundamentally social practice, so I encourage you to come if you would like to talk about anything.

And if you are unable to make my above hours, please reach out to me, and we can work out a time that is more convenient to you. 

Warmly,\
Syan
