## Philosophy: What, why, and how?

### A quick word about materials & interactions in our class

- Some of our readings and discussions can be personally difficult; we’re here if you need to talk.
- Philosophy is full of disagreements, but you can disagree without being a prick—let’s take care of each other!
- When I or your TA challenges you with follow-up questions, it means we are interested in what you are saying, not that we’re upset with you!!
- I like to compare teaching to “crowd work” in standup comedy. I don’t mind questions or occasional interjections (we may adjust as we go). And my apologies if I interject—I’m working on it!
- Sometimes people read my sense of humor as passive aggression; again, I apologize!

### Philosophy: What?

How are Calvin and Hobbes talking past each other?

*Discussion question*: How do different disciplines interpret what the question “why are we here?” is asking? What seems to be different about philosophy’s approach in particular?

- Astronomy?
- Evolutionary biology?
- Religion?
- History?
- Women’s and gender studies?
- Philosophy??

Canonical categories of philosophical questions:

- *Metaphysics* (reality): Are we anywhere? Who are we? What is the nature of our reality?
- *Epistemology* (knowledge): How do we know we are here? (Do we know?)
- *Ethics* (good/bad, right/wrong, etc.): What are we here for? Is it good that we are here?
- *Political Philosophy* (how should we live together?): How should *we* be here?

A historically narrow (Western) canon of philosophy has been slowly expanding; we’ll spend a lot of time together thinking about how—as well as why this is needed in the first place.

### Philosophy: Why?

Jennifer Morton, in today’s reading, considers three answers:

- Philosophy teaches [critical thinking and analytical writing](https://dailynous.com/value-of-philosophy/charts-and-graphs).
  - Morton finds this “dispassionate answer” to be “rather disappointing” (p. 103) Why do you think that is? 
- Philosophy aims at fundamental truths.
  - Why does Morton reject this answer as well? Is this right?
- Philosophy offers an “antidote to the uncritical acceptance of the world and ourselves as we are.”
  - What does this amount to? Morton on the merely critical vs. also constructive/imaginative/remedial.

*Discussion question*: Does Morton also sell philosophy short?

### Philosophy: How?

Philosophy is a distinctive genre of texts; we are going to work with primary rather than secondary texts.

- Philosophy is egalitarian: We treat even the most famous philosophers as equal participants in a long conversation.
- Philosophy is anti-dogmatic: We don’t believe something because parents, society, etc., tell us so; we believe what we reflectively endorse and can “own up to.”
- Philosophy is democratic: No interpretation should be taken for granted; we can and are all really just trying to figure things out.

Philosophy is an *activity* we do, not specific facts to be memorized.

- For me, a philosophy classroom is not where students come to passively learn about different philosophies (though we will of course do a lot of learning!).
- It’s where we come to *do philosophy together*—think of us as a book club!

We will approach this class as a themed first course in philosophy.

- Take a look at all the helpful [advice from previous students](https://intro.dingherself.com/handouts/advice-from-previous-students.html).
- Read the assigned texts carefully and critically before class (see also the participation section of our syllabus for advice).
- Come to class with questions or just things you want to discuss from the readings!
- Bring a copy of the readings with you.
- There will be a handout posted the course website, but take your own notes as well.
- Talk through your thoughts with the class, and ask lots of questions.
- Ideas are powerful—don’t underestimate them!
- They are also deeply personal relevant; philosophy isn’t just intellectual. Think about the ideas in this class in relation to your own experiences and the world around you!
