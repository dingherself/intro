title: The Lover of Wisdom I
module: "Portraits of a philosopher"
---

*Philosophía*: “Love of wisdom.”

- Love in Ancient Greece:
  - *Erôs*: Passionate love (think Sappho).
  - *Agapé*: Selfless, benevolent, unconditional love.
  - *Philía*: More “friendly” (by contemporary light), affectionate/non-passionate love.
- Philosophy is delineated by way of two contrasts:
  - The philosophers are not ordinary folks.
  - The philosophers are not other intellectuals.
    - Not poets like Hesiod or Homer.
      - The philosophers are after naturalistic explanations of the world—i.e., those that do not involve the supernatural.
    - Plato: Also not *sophists* like Protagoras.
      - The sophists were professional public speakers who traveled to teach wisdom.
      - According to Plato, whereas a philosopher like Socrates is seriously interested in seeking the truth, sophists merely rely on rhetoric (“sophistry”) and please the crowd.
    - So, quite ironically, not everyone who loves wisdom counts as a philosopher!
  - Note that there isn’t a contrast between philosophy and what we today think of as science (e.g., Parmenides on pregnancy/sex, B17–18).

“Presocratic philosophers”: Philosophers prior to Socrates.

- Not really a time thing: Many of the presocratic philosophers and Socrates were contemporaries. 
  - Note the implication: Socrates is used here as a special reference point; the subtext is that philosophy *really* began with Socrates.
- The presocratic philosophers didn’t (and couldn’t) quite identify as philosophers, even though what they did has come to be recognized as philosophical.
  - They were predecessors to Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle in a distinct lineage.
  - Their questions, concerns, and methods were inherited by S/P/A and have come to define the Western philosophical tradition.

## An illustrative example: Heraclitus’ *logos*

Starting point: 

- The world is *ordered*: There is a naturalistic/non-supernatural principle (“first principle”) that governs, drives, and explains the world.
- This principle is *intelligible*: It’s feasible, even if difficult, to know it through human reason.

Two closely connected meanings of *logos*:

- The explanatory/organizing *principle* of the world.
- *Reason*, including its product—rational explanation.

Cf. Parmenides’ goddess (fr. 2):

> But come now, I will tell you—and you, when you have heard the story, bring it safely away—<br />
> which are the only routes of inquiry that are for thinking:<br />
> the one, that is and that it is not possible for it not to be,<br />
> is the path of Persuasion (for it attends upon Truth),<br />
> the other, that it is not and that it is right that it not be,<br />
> this indeed I declare to you to be a path entirely unable to be investigated:<br />
> For neither can you know what is not (for it is not to be accomplished)<br />
> nor can you declare it.

Among the presocratics, the first principle is characteristically identified as an originating point—i.e., the stuff out of which everything originated.

- Heraclitus: Fire.
- Thales (predating Heraclitus’ *logos* talk): Water.
- Anaximander (also predating Heraclitus): *Apeiron*.
  - “[The first principle] is neither water nor any of the other things called elements, but some other nature which is *apeiron*, out of which come to be all the heavens and the worlds in them” (12A9 + 12B1).
  - “He declares that what arose from the eternal and is productive of [or, “capable of giving birth to”] hot and cold was separated off at the coming to be of this *kosmos*, and a kind of sphere of flame from this grew around the dark mist about the earth like bark about a tree. When it was broken off and enclosed in certain circles, the sun, moon, and stars came to be” (12A10).

## Another illustrative example: Sappho of Lesbos

- Not generally recognized as a lesbian until quite recently.
  - Patriarchy took my girl: Fr. 31.
  - Too gay to function: Fr. 94.
- Not generally recognized as a philosopher.
  - Sappho is clearly interested in a kind of wisdom, but:
    - She reflects on love (a full-body experience vs. a mere feeling), desire, longing (“yearn”), memory, change, sorrow, family, [women’s] beauty …
    - She loves wisdom in a different way: A focus on the sensual, the affective, the bodily, the romantic, the erotic.
  - Does this still make her a philosopher? Who gets to decide this?
  - “I say someone in another time will remember us” (fr. 147).
