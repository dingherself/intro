## Today

- Welcome! :-)
- Philosophy: What, why, and how?
  - Bathroom break

- Course logistics
- Questions? & Plans for next week

## Philosophy: What?

Calvin and Hobbes comic: How are Calvin and Hobbes talking past each other?

*In-class activity: How would different fields go about answering the question “why are we here?” What seems to be different about philosophy’s approach in particular?*

- Astronomy?
- Evolutionary biology?
- Anthropology?
- History?
- Women’s and gender studies?
- Philosophy??

## Philosophy: Why?

Jennifer Morton, in today’s reading, considers three answers:

- Philosophy teaches [critical thinking and analytical writing](https://dailynous.com/value-of-philosophy/charts-and-graphs).
  - Morton finds this “dispassionate answer” to be “rather disappointing” (p. 103) Why do you think that is? 
- Philosophy aims at fundamental truths.
  - Why does Morton reject this answer as well? Is this right?
- Morton’s answer: Philosophy offers an “antidote to the uncritical acceptance of the world and ourselves as we are” (p. 104).
  - What does this amount to? Morton on the merely critical vs. also constructive/imaginative/remedial.

*Question for discussion: Does Morton’s answer also sell philosophy short?*

## Philosophy: How?

### Philosophy is an activity we do, not specific facts to be memorized.

- Philosophy is a distinctive genre of texts: We are going to work with primary rather than secondary texts.
- Philosophy is democratic: We treat these famous philosophers as *our equals* in a long conversation; philosophy really is for everybody.
- Philosophy is anti-dogmatic: We believe something not because parents, society, etc., told us so, but because we reflectively endorse and “own up to” them; most of the time, we are all really just figuring things out.
- So, philosophy is not “just opinions” or “no wrong answers”: Ideas and even truths abound. Not every idea ought to be taken equally seriously, nor is every truth equally significant. Don’t forget to ask: Is this right? What are we trying to do here?
- Good philosophy should also be fun! I want us to get our hands directly, so to speak.

### I’d like us to think of our classroom as where we come to *do philosophy together!

- Usual class structure: Brief introduction -> small group discussion -> whole class discussion -> what I want you to out of from the reading -> whole class discussion.
- To make this work, I expect everybody to have read the assigned readings *carefully* and *critically* before coming to class (see the syllabus for tips).
- Course lexicon: Philosophy words are hard and I want to help.
- Bring the readings with you to class!
- There will be a handout posted the course website; take your own notes as well.
- Don’t be afraid to ask right away if you have a question, if you are not sure what we are doing, if I use a word you don’t understand, etc.

### Let’s take care of each other!

- Some of the materials will be difficult for a lot of students; I’m here if you need to talk.
- Philosophy is full of disagreements.
  - You can disagree without being a prick.
  - When I challenge you with follow-up questions, it means I’m interested in what you are saying, not that I’m upset with you!!
  - Sometimes people read my sense of humor as passive aggression—I want to clarify that.

### Teaching Assistant for Sec. 003

- If you are enrolled in the afternoon/larger section, your first point of contact for questions et alia is our TA, Nick Witchey.
- If your section is in the morning, I’m your go-to person; please do not reach out to Nick.

### Office hours

- Come to talk to me about both the substance and the logistics of the course; I would also genuinely love to get to know you more!
- No signups needed; candy box provided.
- If my office hours don’t work for you, please suggest three or four times for us to meet (“make an appointment”).

**Ideas are powerful—don’t underestimate them!**

## If something goes wrong

Please reach out if there’s something going on in your life (it happens!).

### Absences

- Email me if there’s a reason you can’t come to class (I consider mental health to be a legitimate reason for missing class).
- To catch up: do the readings, read the handout, get notes from at least two classmates, and come to office hours to discuss questions/thoughts.

### Makeups & extensions

- If you email me six hours prior to the deadline: No questions asked.
- A little bit later: A little bit of question asked.
- Much later: A legitimate reason expected.

## Tour of …

- Course website: <https://intro.dingherself.com>
  - We will use CourseWroks only for things that need to be hid behind a password (assignments/grades/certain readings).
- Reading schedule
  - Chronically logic + thematic logic.
  - The diversification discussion in philosophy.
  - If a reading is not directly linked, I will upload it to CourseWorks > Files.

- Assignments/exams

## Plans for Monday

- Please fill out the “getting to know you” survey if you have not already!
- Find *Analects* fragments on the reading schedule—don’t be intimidated! these are short fragments.
  - Confucius [*Kongfuzi* 孔夫子, or *Kongzi* 孔子 for short]: roughly, ‘Master Kong.’
    - *Fuzi*: A gendered honorific for men, [male] teachers, and husbands.
    - *Kong*: His family name.
  - *Analects* [*Lunyu* 论语]: roughly, ‘collected sayings.’
    - There is a pun of sorts: *lun* means both ‘discuss’ and ‘select’; *yu* means ‘sayings’ or ‘speeches.’
  - The introduction in our selections is a useful overview of some important concepts.
