## Kant on Enlightenment

“Enlightenment is the human being’s emergence from his self-incurred minority.”

- What is Kant saying?
- What are the implicit assumptions that Kant is invoking in order to say this?

## Reason in philosophy

- The world is governed by a higher power (Heaven, God).
- Because of this there is an order (Dao, Logos) to this world; we do not live in pure chaos, even though things might sometimes appear so.
  - Appearance is deceptive; our senses and emotions are misleading.
- A distinct feature of the Western tradition descending from ancient Greece as interpreted through the medieval Arabic world: This order is accessible to us through reason.
  - Reason is our connection to the higher power; our rational capacity is in an important way sacred.
  - While our senses and emotions are misleading, reason guides us towards deeper reality and real wisdom.
  - The body—defined by the sensory and the affective—is what limits us.

## What if this is all a mistake?

Working with your group, think of a contemporary example that the parable could be analogous to and use this to try to work out its meaning:

- Camus’s Sisyphus
- Nietzsche’s Madman
- Anderson’s Asteroid City

## The existentialist project

*Abandonment*: God is dead (and has never lived), whose consequences we must face up to ourselves.

- *Anguish*: We make our own decisions in a state of anguish—akin to the general who sends soldiers to die (p. 27).
  - The general is making their own decision and must bear the responsibility of its consequences; they do not merely follow orders.
- *Despair*: We have to act without hope because we can control only what’s up to us.
  - There is no assurance that the train will come tomorrow; we just have to live with it.

Sartre: “Existentialists . . . find it extremely disturbing that God no longer exists.” Why?

- Camus: “There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide.”
- Philosophy is not just thought, but action.
- Without reason, there is nothing to lean on, “no values or orders that can legitimize our conduct.”
- Everything is up for grabs.

Sartre’s proposal: Reverse the priority between essence and existence.

- Essence precedes existence: We do what we do because of what we are/our nature.
  - Midge Campbell: “You took a picture of me. . . . Why?”
  - Augie Steenbeck: “I’m a photographer.”
- Existence precedes essence: We are what we make ourselves to be.
  - Sartre: “man first exists: he materializes in the world, encounters himself, and only afterward defines himself.”
  - Example of the young man (pp. 33–34).
  - Note the plural: In choosing for myself, I’m defining not only my own nature but human nature. “Although it is true that in confronting any real situation, for example that I am capable of having sexual intercourse with a member of the opposite sex and of having children, I am obliged to choose an attitude toward the situation, and in any case I bear the responsibility of a choice that, in committing myself, also commits humanity [to monogamy] as a whole.”

For Sartre, existentialism is not ultimately interested in proving that God does not exist: “even if God were to exist, it would make no difference.”

- We are our own legislators.
