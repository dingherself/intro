*Due*: Wednesday, March 25, by the beginning of class, to CourseWorks > Assignments\
*Format*: Short video recording of your post-movie discussion, along with a brief note describing when/where your screening took place and who participated in it

Please host a screening of [*The Matrix*](https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/20032123) (streamable through the library) with at least two classmates, friends, and/or family members; I’ll make a discussion thread for those looking to invite others.

Afterwards, please discuss Morpheus’s question to Neo when they reenter the Matrix for the first time: *What is real? How do you define 'real'?*
