## Three levels of Cartesian doubt

What can I be certain of?

Descartes:

> I will suppose . . . some malicious demon of the utmost power and cunning has employed all his energies in order to deceive me. I shall think that the sky, the air, the earth, colours, shapes, sounds and all external things are merely the delusions of dreams which he has devised to ensnare my judgement. I shall consider myself as not having hands or eyes, or flesh, or blood or senses, but as falsely believing that I have all these things. (AT 23)

This is a *skeptical scenario* where appearance (how things *seem* to be) comes apart from reality (how things in fact *are*).

- Is there any good basis for believing that we do not live in a skeptical scenario?
- Descartes: *Cogito, ergo sum*; I think, therefore I am.

## Russell’s strategy: Inference to the best explanation (IBE)

Russell: IBE offers us good reason for believing, even if it does not *prove*, that we are not in a skeptical scenario.

Observations: It hasn’t rained; the grass is wet.

- Hypothesis I: It rained.
- Hypothesis II: The sprinklers came on.
- Hypothesis III: Grass does not get wet on its own without being rained on except at BC where laws of nature do not apply.
- Hypothesis IV: Aliens visited BC to play water pistols.

Some theoretical virtues:

- *Explanatory power*: How well does the hypothesis render the observations predictable/expectable?
- *Parsimony*: How many principles and entities does the hypothesis postulate in order to do this? (“Ockham’s razor”)
- *Consistency*: How well does the hypothesis avoid contradicting itself?
- *Unity*: How well does the hypothesis avoid *ad hoc* elements that don’t integrate into a whole?
- *Conservatism*: How well does the hypothesis cohere with already-established theories?

Observations: There appear to be tables, chairs, …

- Real-world hypothesis: There are tables, chairs, …
- Skeptical hypothesis: Say, the Matrix.

Russell: The real-world hypothesis should be preferred because it is more “simple” or less elaborate.

- Is it?
