## Today

- Wrap up Mozi
- Introduce the Western philosophical tradition
- Philosophy vs. poetry (as time allows)

## Philosophía

Literally, “love of wisdom.”

### Love in the Ancient Greek social world

- *Erôs*: Passionate love (think Sappho).
- *Agapé*: Selfless, benevolent, unconditional love.
- *Philía*: More general; “friendly” (by contemporary light), affectionate/non-passionate love.

### The philosophers

The philosophers are delineated by way of two contrasts:
- The philosophers are not ordinary folks.
- The philosophers, whose craft is reason, are not other intellectuals. [Hyunsung]
  - Not poets like Hesiod or Homer.
    - The philosophers are after naturalistic explanations of the world—i.e., those that do not involve the supernatural.
  - Plato: Also not *sophists* like Protagoras.
    - The sophists were professional public speakers who traveled to teach wisdom.
    - According to Plato, whereas a philosopher like Socrates is seriously interested in seeking the truth, sophists merely rely on rhetoric (“sophistry”) and please the crowd. [Nimisha, Lea]
  - So, quite ironically, not everyone who loves wisdom counts as a philosopher!
- Note that there isn’t a contrast between philosophy and what would we today think of as science (e.g., Parmenides on pregnancy/sex, B17–18). [Nikita, Lucy, Charlie]

### Pre-Socratic philosophers

Literally, philosophers prior to Socrates.

- Not really a time thing: Many of them were Socrates’ contemporaries. 
  - Note the implication: Socrates is used here as a special reference point; the subtext is that [Western!] philosophy *really* began with Socrates.
- These philosophers are thus positioned as predecessors to Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle in a distinct lineage of texts.
  - Their questions, concerns, and methods were inherited by S/P/A and have come to define the Western philosophical tradition.

## An illustrative example: Heraclitus’ *logos*

Starting point: 

- The world is *ordered*: There is a naturalistic/non-supernatural principle (“first principle”) that governs, drives, and explains the world. [Nikita, Candence]
- This principle is *intelligible*: It’s feasible, even if difficult, to know it through human reason. [Yasmine]

Two closely connected meanings of *logos*:

- The explanatory/organizing *principle* of the world.
- *Reason*, including its product—rational explanation.

Cf. Parmenides’ goddess (fr. 2): [Willow, Sofia, Samantha]

> But come now, I will tell you—and you, when you have heard the story, bring it safely away—<br />
> which are the only routes of inquiry that are for thinking:<br />
> the one, that is and that it is not possible for it not to be,<br />
> is the path of Persuasion (for it attends upon Truth),<br />
> the other, that it is not and that it is right that it not be,<br />
> this indeed I declare to you to be a path entirely unable to be investigated:<br />
> For neither can you know what is not (for it is not to be accomplished)<br />
> nor can you declare it.

Among the Pre-Socratics, the first principle is characteristically identified as an originating point—i.e., the stuff/matter out of which everything originated.

- Heraclitus: Fire.
- Thales (predating Heraclitus’ *logos* talk): Water.
- Anaximander (also predating Heraclitus): *Apeiron*.
  - “[The first principle] is neither water nor any of the other things called elements, but some other nature which is *apeiron*, out of which come to be all the heavens and the worlds in them” (12A9 + 12B1).
  - “He declares that what arose from the eternal and is productive of [or, ‘capable of giving birth to’] hot and cold was separated off at the coming to be of this *kosmos*, and a kind of sphere of flame from this grew around the dark mist about the earth like bark about a tree. When it was broken off and enclosed in certain circles, the sun, moon, and stars came to be” (12A10).

## Another illustrative example: Sappho of Lesbos

- Entry in Wittig & Zerg’s [*Lesbian Peoples: Material for a Dictionary*](https://archive.org/details/lesbianpeoplesma00witt).
  - Both “sapphic” and “lesbian” allude to Sappho. [Lilah]
- Not generally recognized as a lesbian until quite recently.
  - [r/SapphoAndHerFriends](https://www.reddit.com/r/SapphoAndHerFriend/comments/mim4x0/my_reading_for_gender_perspective_says_sappho/)
  - Translations: Frs. [126](https://www.reddit.com/r/SapphoAndHerFriend/comments/s2htby/this_is_literally_sappho_and_her_friend/) and [102](https://www.reddit.com/r/SapphoAndHerFriend/comments/1dtd23n/the_first_sappho_poetry_book_i_bought_and_i_come/).
  - Patriarchy took my girl: Fr. 31.
  - Too gay to function: Fr. 94.
  - Women are so pretty: Fr. 108.
- Not generally recognized as a philosopher.
  - In addition to *eros*, Sappho reflects on desire, longing (“yearn”) [Sophie], memory, change, sorrow, family, [women’s] beauty …
    - “[Brothers Song](https://www.amacad.org/publication/daedalus/new-brothers-poem-sappho)” rediscovered in 2014.
  - But she loves wisdom in an affective (cf. rational—but be careful about drawing a sharp line) way: A focus on the sensual, the bodily, the erotic. [Lucy]
    - Love is the “loosener of limbs, bittersweet and inescapable” which “seizes” us in a full-body experience (fr. 130).
    - Is Sappho too delicate/soft when sapphic love is so intense?
  - Who gets to decide who is a philosopher? What counts as philosophical? What’s at stake? [Charlie]
- “I say someone in another time will remember us” (fr. 147).
